<h3>nav-stack demo</h3>
<p>still meager, but some cool concepts starting to brew:</p>

<ul>
  <li>each "frame" of the stack has its own URL</li>
  <li>concurrent routing: each frame is a different route being rendered at the same time as any other</li>
  <li>this approach to nav+routing can be used to build the coveted iOS interactive mobile swipable outlet</li>
  <li>
    scoped services: each frame has its own DI scope, managed by the nav-stack
    <ul>
      <li>
        In this demo, each frame has its own scoped router;
        each frame has a separate myRouter scoped service, but every component
        rendered within the same frame shares the same instance of myRouter.
      </li>
      <li>
        The concept of a scoped router is necessary for what I plan on doing with
        ember-constraint-router: today, every link-to / transitionTo has direct
        global access to a singleton router, but in this setup, there are many micro routers,
        and it's the nav-stack that gets to decide what to do when various child routers report
        an intent to link-to elsewhere, or report that some constraint has been violated, etc.
        The nav-stack can decide how to resolve complex constraint violations (e.g. you've pushed
        5 frames onto the nav stack, and 4 of them invalidate at the same time because the server
        tells you the user is logged out). This is what I hope to demo next.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
